                          <div>The education system in the UK is divided into four main parts, primary education, secondary education, further education and higher education. Children in the UK have to legally attend primary and secondary education which runs from about 5 years old until the student is 16 years old.</div>

                          <div>The education system in the UK is also split into "key stages" which breaks down as follows:</div>
                          <ul>
                              <li>Key Stage 1: 5 to 7 years old</li>
                              <li>Key Stage 2: 7 to 11 years old</li>
                              <li>Key Stage 3: 11 to 14 years old</li>
                              <li>Key Stage 4: 14 to 16 years old</li>
                          </ul>
                          <div>Students are assessed at the end of each stage. The most important assessment occurs at age 16 when students pursue their GCSE's or General Certificate of Secondary Education.</div>

                          <div>The UK has a vast variety of higher education opportunities to offer students with over 100 universities offering various degree programs for students from the UK and around the world. In the UK about one-third of all students go on to some form of higher education and this number is well over 50% for students from Scotland. This makes competition for places very fierce and so it is advised to apply early for courses.</div>
